        <strong>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup
        language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It
        defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted
        by technologies such as
        <strong> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> and scripting languages
        such as <strong>JavaScript</strong>. HTML describes the structure of a
        web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

      <h1>CSS! üíÑ</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a style sheet language
        used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written
        in HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and
        presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation
        improves content accessibility, provides more flexibility and controls
        in the specification of presentation. <br />The name
        <strong>cascading</strong> comes from the specified priority scheme to
        determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a
        property match a particular element.

      <h1>JavaScript! üß†</h1>
      <p>
        JavaScript; abbreviated as <strong>JS</strong>, is a programming
        language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of
        websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior. Web
        browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client
        code.
        <br />
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing,
        prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It has
        <strong>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</strong> for working
        with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
        <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>.
